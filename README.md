## :dart: About

Tired of passing props down the component tree, aren't you?

I know that's sucks.

Sometimes you use Redux or Context API, but it's not always the best solution.

Because you need to create a lot of boilerplate code.

Or even worse, you just need to pass a simple value from one component to another.

And that's why I created React Trigger State.

So, with React Trigger State you can trigger state changes from anywhere in your application.

And what about if the user goes to another page and goes back?

Well, don't worry, because we store the data so you don't need to waste your time!

Don't believe me?

## :eyes: See it in action

<p>See these stories <a href="https://6411132c8debbccc1a851060-genjkthnwu.chromatic.com/?path=/story/function--function" target="_blank">by clicking here</a></p>

Others example will be provided through the documentation.

## ::thinking_face: Show me how
Take a look at this diagram:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gabrieldeavila/react-trigger-state/master/public/diagram.png" alt="React Trigger State Diagram" />

So, with React Trigger State, two components can communicate with each other without having a parent-child relationship.

## :crystal_ball: useTriggerState

This hook makes it possible to trigger state changes from anywhere in the application.

First you need to initialize it:

```js
import { useTriggerState } from "react-trigger-state";

// in a component
const [state, setState] = useTriggerState({
  name: "my_first_state",
  initial: "Wow, looks like it's magic!",
});
```

Then, you can get its value:

```js
import { useTriggerState } from "react-trigger-state";

// in another component
const [state, setState] = useTriggerState({
  name: "my_first_state",
});
```

Yep, that's only it!

And you can use it like a normal state.

Didn't get it?
Ok, try these CodeSandbox examples:

<p><a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/usetriggerstate-example-js-z3dzlu?file=/src/App.js" target="_blank">For JS lovers ðŸ¥°</a></p>

<p><a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/usetriggerstate-basic-example-9ukf2s?file=/src/App.tsx" target="_blank">For TS lovers ðŸ¤—</a></p>

## :crystal_ball: useTriggerFunction and useGetFunction

It's possible to create functions that can be called from anywhere in the application.

First you need to create one:

```js
import { useTriggerFunction } from "react-trigger-state";

// in a component
const myFirstFunction = useCallback(() => {
  // your complex logic here
  alert("wow, im a function!");
}, []);

useTriggerFunction({
  name: "my_first_function",
  share: myFirstFunction,
});
```

And then you only need to do this:

```js
import { useGetFunction } from "react-trigger-state";

// in another component
const myFirstFunction = useGetFunction({ name: "my_first_function" });

// and then you can call it
myFirstFunction();
```

Easy, right?

If you found it hard to understand, try this CodeSandbox example:

## :crystal_ball: useTriggerRef

Last but not least, let's share a ref between components.

First you need to create one, like this:

```js
import { useTriggerRef } from "react-trigger-state";

// in a component
const [ref, setRef] = useTriggerRef({
  name: "ref_ex",
  initial: "--",
});
```

And then, anywhere in the application you should be doing this:

```js
import { useTriggerRef } from "react-trigger-state";

// in another component
const [ref, setRef] = useTriggerRef({
  name: "ref_ex",
});

function handleClick() {
  setRef("wow, it's magic!");
}
```

YEP! We don't use `ref.current = "wow, it's magic!"`

Because by doing that, you would not be triggering an event and others components wouldn't get it.

But calm down, because it works like a normal ref, therefore, it will not trigger an `useEffect` whenever it changes.

Did you get it?

If you didn't, try this CodeSandbox example:

## :inbox_tray: Installation

So simple, right?

Why don't you try it?

Install it and start using it right now!

NPM

```bash
npm i react-trigger-state
```

Yarn

```bash
yarn add react-trigger-state
```

PS: please, I'd really appreciate if you could give me a star on the project.
